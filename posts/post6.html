        <h2>the nexus event.</h2>

            The term “Nexus Event” is coined in arguably my most favorite Marvel Studios’ production, Loki. A Nexus Event describes a very pivotal point in a timeline such that a new timeline emerges.
            <br><br>
            2022 was so unique in film. It seems like everyone was riding along the Marvel bandwagon and incorporating Multiversal themes in their story. Prime Cruz’s <i>“Ngayon Kaya”</i> tells the story of two best-friends as they look back in the past and why their relationship never took off. They had conversations about multiverses. What if one of them hadn’t flown to Canada? What if they had formed a band together? What if they had stayed?
            <br><br>
            On the other hand, one of my most favorite films which touches on this topic is Daniel Scheinert and Daniel Kwan’s Everything Everywhere All at Once. This one’s not about questions of what ifs. It’s on the idea of nihilism that is realized through discovering the countless lives we could’ve had if we had decided things differently earlier. At its pivotal moment, Evelyn finally sees Waymond underneath his naiveness and in all multiverses. <i>“So, even though you have broken my heart yet again, I wanted to say… In another life, I would have really liked just doing laundry and taxes with you.”</i>
            <br><br>
            What’s really fascinating about the multiversal theme is the weight of choices (and even choicelessness) and its bearing in our lives. I found that many choices I’ve made helped form who I am as a person today. Nexus Events open the door to new opportunities, but closing the door to some. But how do we choose? Do we choose decisively or do we leave it with fate?
            <br><br>
            I find myself at a very vital stage of my life. Another Nexus Event which is a sequel of another which happened more than two years ago. I left my home country to seek new opportunities and experiences in Australia. Now, my time is almost up in this place. I have to make a big decision soon: Do I leave and bring my experiences with me? Do I stay further? Or do I leave temporarily.
            <br><br>
            I’ve always hated the Filipino-way of making decisions: playing it safe. Play it safe. Study really hard and get good grades - because that’s the only way you’ll succeed in life. Finish a degree in college - because that’s the only way you can get a good job. Find work after college and spend your entire life working - because that’s the only way to live.
            <br><br>
            I always like to do things unconventionally. Because after all, how do you make something unique in your life if you always try to group yourself with the horde? I guess that’s why I ended up going to Australia. That’s why I ended up doing entrepreneurship instead of playing it safe.
            <br><br>
            It’s hard, yes. But, the amount of growth and things I’ve learned overshadows any stresses I’ve witnessed ever since.
            <br><br>
            That’s just the thing. People worry about making the right decisions, when it’s the risky decisions which deliver the most growth. People are too scared to fail or fall down when you cannot grow and learn if you don't do so first. People are too comfortable and by the time things matter, they are already too late.
            <br><br>
            I guess I have my mom to owe for how I think: she never really tried to make a better life for us. It was frustrating. I was only made to wait for things to get better, but it never did for 23 years of my life.
            <br><br>
            Making decisions - whether they’re safe or not is in nature. It’s how it’s supposed to be in life. After all, the chaos of the Multiverse is made from the chaos of decisions we made in our everyday life.

                <br>
                Just how long 'til she's stripped from me?
                <br>
                So come on, baby, in time we'll all freeze
                <br>

            Let’s see what chaos my next Nexus Event will make.
