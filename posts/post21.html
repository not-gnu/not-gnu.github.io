          A short note for September:
          <br><br>
          This September is pretty much just okay. It’s the first month of Spring and I was honestly expecting it to still be cool - like almost winter-like, but this month has been warmer than I expected.
        </p>

        <p><b>18th September 2025.</b></p>

        <p>
          Sukey asked me to represent her in the Australian Chinese Alumni Association (ACAA) Award Ceremony happening in the Event Centre at Taronga Zoo.
          <br><br>
          Admittedly, I was not too excited about the event. I just had an excuse to visit the zoo and look at kangaroos and koalas. The day started out very bland. I noticed a lot of small scratches appearing around my body. I have a couple on my face, my arms, and legs. I don’t know if it’s dry skin or stressed, but I’m not worrying to much at the moment.
          <br><br>
          I didn’t do much work throughout the week. I’m not sure why - I’ve been quite busy the past two weeks. Maybe I just felt I need to take a breather for this week.
          <br><br>
          The event starts at 6 PM. I knew I had to get there at least a bit earlier. I don’t necessarily have to pay to enter the zoo to look at kangaroos and koalas. There’s a small public viewing area where you can do so. I took a bus from Crow’s Nest where our kitchen is located all the way to Mosman.
        </p>

        <p>
          Mosman is one of the richest suburbs in Sydney. Owning a house (or even renting here) means you may be a big-time person. I actually never had explored the Northern Beaches. Other than the place being very inaccessible due to the lack of public transportation (thanks to NIMBYs), I just found the place to be too - rich. I’m talking Beverly Hills-type of people roaming around with designer clothing and expensive storefronts around the area. On the bus to Taronga Zoo however, I found quite a lot of places I want to visit. The place feels like a mix of London and a beach town. I made a mental note to myself to at least explore the place in the future.
        </p>

        <p>
          Anyway, I hopped off the 100 bus at the Taronga Zoo entrance. I made my way to the public viewing deck and watched some kangaroos hop around.
          <br><br>
          The venue was located to the side of the entrance. You can’t see the koalas at the public viewing area unfortunately, but you can spot them when you walk by the side-entrance.
          <br><br>
          I did see some koalas - and it made my day.
        </p>

        <p>
          That’s not what I was after. I know Taronga Zoo and Mosman is known for THAT view. The venue’s name is even called “Harbourside view.” I knew I just had to get a sunset shot of it.

          It’s quite beautiful honestly. There’s a reason why Mosman is notorious for being one of the most expensive suburbs to live in at Sydney. The views are amazing. The amazing local culture, summer-aesthetic, and British style gives it it’s very unique personality.
          <br><br>
          The event was quite posh. I was surrounded by some really successful people with all sorts of achievements: mostly those with asian or a Chinese heritage. I got to a point where I was in a conversation where 7-8 figures was being talked about. I felt out of place the whole time and I didn’t make any fruitful conversations. I mostly just enjoyed the evening and attempted to inspire myself by other Chinese migrant stories and their successes in Australia.
          <br><br>
          It was also the first time I tried haute food. Haute is basically the types of dishes you would see in high-end restaurants. Ratatouille comes into mind. It’s basically dishes served with smaller portions and the detail is made in the taste, texture, and presentation of the dish.
          <br><br>
          It’s very posh and not my taste. Admittedly, I always hated going to these events because I never really grew up rich. I feel like I always have to pretend to be someone else to fit in and I guess it just sucks off all of the energy I have in me.
        </p>

        <p>
          I guess that’s also the issue with me living alone in Australia surrounded by people from different cultures and backgrounds: it just takes so much energy from me everyday just to fit-in and make myself comfortable. But I know I have to do it because I know that I need to step out of my comfort zone. I need to put myself out there, try to talk to people, and make those opportunities.
          <br><br>
          Anyway, I’m happy with the day. I get to witness a nice view of Sydney, saw some koalas and kangaroo, and get a taste of that posh way of living.

        <p><b>29th September 2025.</b></p>

        <p>
          September’s been really dull, draining, and stressful honestly.
          <br><br>
          Lately, I’ve been getting the same feeling again of what I felt from April to May last year: the feeling of anxiety of what will happen next.
          <br><br>
          Thing’s are good, don’t get me wrong. I’m still working on my startup and I get some extra income through Petko’s catering business.
          <br><br>
          I feel like my mind keeps on shifting in-between being pessimistic and cautiously optimistic. It’s really difficult - especially have to think about all of these things myself. Waking up gets harder and harder each day because I don’t know what’s going to happen or if something bad is going to happen. But there are times where I just… fight. I have sudden surges of optimism and hope for the future and just continue running. Yet, this doesn’t last - I get stuck in a cycle.
          <br><br>
          I guess it just sucks that my only source of therapy is myself - having myself to just inspire me and talk me through the things in my life. There are times where I do do self-care such as writing here, nature journaling, watching films, or listening to music. But in the end, I still feel very empty and admittedly pessimistic.
          <br><br>
          There are times like right now where I do think about giving up - but I know I need to fight. But then I look at where I am right now and what I’m doing and then I realize that I can’t just give up.
          <br><br>
          These are not a good mindset to have especially with the things that I’m doing. I know that I need a lot of mental resilience to achieve the goals that I’m aiming myself for. But I think I just need this time to be honest with myself - to describe these feelings of loneliness and anxiety.
          <br><br>
          It’s hard to star motivated all the time and I really envy those who can just remain so. Every night, I always find myself cuddling beside Kirby before going to bed, play my comfort playlist on the speaker, and just cry.
          <br><br>
          Such is life, I’ll just continue fighting.
          <br><br>
          Cheers to wherever I’ll be in the coming months. :)
