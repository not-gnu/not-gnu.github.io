            <b>Intro written 31 Aug:</b>Today is the last day of winter. Soon the first day of spring.
            <br><br>
            Days will slowly get hotter and longer. Perennial flowers will soon bloom. Magpies will then attack me and Kirby during our walks.
            <br><br>
            I’m hoping (again) that this won’t be my last winter. Hopefully, I won’t spend it alone again. 
            <br><br>
            This winter is probably the best I’ve had so far. I’ve met some amazing people, started doing some extra work, and have made some progress with my projects. I’ve also reunited with Kirby who’s arguably the only one bringing some joy (and stress) to my life.
            <br><br>
            I want to log most of my experiences during this season. The first & second part is a series of photos, while the third is a journal log entry.
            <br><br>
            I want it to be very casual because I'm so busy and preoccupied that I don't want to take non-work stuff too seriously.
            <br><br>
            so: welcome to the...

            04 June: First-time going to Liverpool and the Sydney Southwest. That weird building to the left is the Liverpool Library which is quite honestly the nicest library I visited so far.

            23 July: ok i admit i'm kinda cute (but i definitely won't admit that.) quite happy with this haircut. I was scared i'm going full aussie and have a mullet - but my stylist was able to do quite a good wolf cut.

            25 July: first-time visiting the new UTS Startups space. sean treated us into a german pub and taught us some german pub & beer culture. best shnitzel i've ever tasted. not pictured but at the end of the day, sean and i went to this basque street-side bar. the waiter looked like f1 driver charles leclerc - even literally spoke like him (he was french). he had the mustache, messy hair, the eyes, jawline, and everything. asked him if he gets asked about f1 and immediately replied "oh yeah charles leclerc." he said he even gets people having photos with him.

            27 July: I have a friend named valerie went home to hong kong last july. we spent a sunday afternoon going to marrickville. found probably my most favorite book store ever - urchin books. they have this little reading corner and they sometimes also have cats in it. she knows about my koalas and she really likes stitch. we argued over which was cuter. she also introduced me to matcha + chocolate matcha with was honestly tasted really amazing.
