            I took this photo last 01 August 2025. It was the first cherry blossom which bloomed in the neighbourhood. I don't know, it just looked so pretty. I once saw an asian couple who seemed lost navigating the neoighbourhood. They looked like tourists. The girl was carrying around a branch with cherry blossom flowers blooming around it. I assume the guy picked it for her. They looked very cute honestly.

            My mom's ex and her ex's sister who became her best friend visited Sydney for a day. Their one sibling lives in Melbourne and went to Sydney for a day. I'm always really happy when someone from home visits Sydney and we meet in this country. There's a surreal feeling of meeting people whom you've grown accustomed to back at home in another country. I had two blockmates from college visit me here already - I miss them so much. These siblings are honestly adorable (mostly the girls.) The guys are nice but they're just too, guy-like? Like they have their own world? Anyway, one of them was my mom's ex so I didn't expect much from him honestly.

            Just another pretty purple sunset with Kirby. I'd say 2-3 weeks of Sydney was just... rain. Literally August by Taylor Swift personified. Here, we were in the middle of the field and there's some sort of slight fog covering the area.

            Have I mentioned how much I LOVE this neighbourhood? I guess it's why the district has the slogan, "Hills: Sydney's Garden Shire."

            After one full-year, I finally was able to watch another live musical. A friend introduced me to the Book of Mormon last 2015. It's a comedy-musical with some pretty dark humour (there was a scene where hitler was heiling while getting a blowjob from a demon.) Funnily enough, this was also the musical which taught me about mormons. I liked it, and I honestly have a lot of thought about religion which probably deserves its own prompt. What I got from this was: If the entire point of mormon missions was to accumulate baptisms and you punish mission divisions for not getting enough baptisms, is it really a religion? or a business? Admittedly, I hated going to mass. I used to attend (and prefer) doing service work to the poor at my local parish back then. Funny how I'm able to see God more doing those service than I ever do during mass.

            One thing I FUCKING missed donig: COOKING! I'm not the best cook, but I really appreciate the art. I have much more to learn, but I guess I'm just happy cooking stuff and tasting, nice?
            <br><br>
            <b>Natural greek yoghurt with apple crumble muesli & chocolate mix, golden kiwi, and banana:</b> My go-to breakfast!! I missed actualy GOOD yoghurt. I tried looking for yoghurt back in the Philippines and they were all SHIT!
            <br>
            <b>Pan-seared chicken shchnitzel breast in olive oil with chips and drenched with lemon:</b> Probably my favorite and a classic aussie fave - there's something I love about mixing friend chicken schnitzels with lemon.
            <br>
            <b>Italian-style carbonara emulsified with bacon fat, peccorino cheese, and eggs:</b> Well, not very traditional - Italian carbonara traditionally uses cured gianchiale meat than bacon. I just can't find a place to buy guanchiable. Anyway, I like this dish too. Filipino-style carbonara has its own charm of course, but this just feels more... healthy?
            <br>
            <b>Sourdough bread with butter, aged blue cheese, mozzarella, and pepperoni:</b> I love this as a breakfast too! Sort of like a makeshift pizza but with good rotten cheese and that tasty sourdough bread!
            <br>
            <b>Roast potatoes mixed with olive oil, rosemary, and oregano:</b> I only cooked this once so far, but fuck I need to do so again! It's just a bit annoying with how long it takes to prepare the potatoes. It's so good though! It reminds me of some REALLY GOOD roast potatoes I ate in a paste restaurant once in Pyrmont.
            <br>
            <b>Creammy omelette with parmesan cheese:</b> THIS IS GOD-TIER OMELETTE (just kidding.) It's really hard to do because you need to have the right heat and be skilled enough to distribute that heat evenly on the egg. Anyway, I cook my omelette as creamy as I can. Not too fried and definitely no browning!
            <br>
            <b>Spaghetti bolognese cooked with red wine, tomato paste:</b> THIS WAS SO GOOD TOO! I'm sorry but filipino-style spaghetti can just burn.
            <br>
            <b>a burger:</b> Just a burger, nothing special. Probably the only thing to note here is that I toast the buns in butter until theyre crunchy. They add something to the burger experience I guess.
            <br><br>
            Again, I'm not a good chef. I wish I knew some more complicated dishes, but I just don't have the luxury of time anymore.
