        <h2>a more interesting year... i guess.</h2>
        <h3>gnu | december 08, 2024</h3>
        <p>
            ok, so i've never gotten to finishing the previous blog LOL. anyway, hello again. whoever i decide to send this to,
            i hope you find solace in hearing my thoughts.
            <br><br>
            it's almost the end of 2024, and a year since i last touched this blog. a lot has happened—mostly bad i would say,
            but i did feel an almost peak happiness for a brief preiod.
            <br><br>
            in 2023, i started a marketing business to get myself going. honestly, i wouldn't say i was really successful. i only
            managed to get at least two clients—both of which came from the generosity of my business mentor. i wouldn't really
            count it as a fulfilling achievement because i never really did anything myself (like get a lead from my effort or
            something)
            <br><br>
            i've been reflecting on the experience. on one hand, it could have been a massive waste of time and i could've sticked
            to different jobs that offers short-term stability and more money. but on the other hand, the experience and lessons
            i've learned is very invaluable and i feel it helped gear me to the next step (i'll talk more about this later.)
            <br><br>
            anyway, i'm still working with two clients. one i practically gave up in-terms of providing the best of my abilities,
            the other, i am trying but it's hard to push the needle because of their business type, difficulty in convincing
            the owner, and earning potential. it's a massive understatement that i'm struggling financially right now, but i am haha.
            <br><br>
            experience-wise, what have i got from it? i learned a lot. (a) entrepreneurs and business-owners are not the sort of
            gods i was predisposed i thought them to be. i thought they are these ultra-smart entities whom i will never be. but in
            reality, they are just like us. they don't know what they are doing most of the time and are just going about it as they
            go along. (b) age doesn't matter. yes it can affect how fast a business gets traction, but one thing stands out: resiliency
            and the capacity of an individual to endure failure and 'not die' from it. (c) they are not always after money. it depends
            on what they are doing. usually, cryptobros, real estate, and other shady/greedy industries are where you will find
            money-hungry people. heck, even the industry in marketing is kind of the same. people who are more often scamming
            other people with a service that makes big promises - yet fail to do so. the 'good' entrepreneurs are those who are 
            absolutely passionate about solving a problem or have a particular advocacy. these are the people that i aspire to be
            and what i want to be. and honestly, the kind of lifestyle i would like.
            <br><br>
            during the latter half of the year, my mentor offered me to live in their apartment as they take vacation in China for 
            three months. mostly, it was to take care of their dog. i lived and saw how they work for at least 5-7 days. it's really 
            fascinating. wake up, cook, and immediately open a laptop and start doing what you're doing. some times, they do go outside 
            for errands, attending events, or meetings. but it's such an interesting life. you're not constrained with the responsibility of
            going to an office as a routine, you work whenever you want, and you are able to stay within the comfort of your home and 
            spend time with your loved ones. other than that, you have absolute full control over all aspects of your life—from how you 
            make money, the steps on doing it, and other such factors. you do not have to rely on other people on how much you earn, 
            how you earn, and how you manage your time. 
            <br><br>
            anyway, that made me reassess what i want to do in life. it could be my goal right now on-top of trying to find a way 
            to stay and live in australia. and without a doubt, that experience is influencing what i am doing right now.
            <br><br>
            so i started the marketing agency last year, but in all honestly, i don't want to work on it anymore. i do not have absolute 
            control over how i want to execute my client's marketing tactics - ones that i absolutely believe will work. other than that,
            i have trouble finding leads. this is mostly not because i am not able to (though hesitancy is a factor), but mostly
            because i am not capable of making empty promises. remember how i told you that marketing agency and the people behind it
            can become borderline scams? that's my point. to convince other people of hiring you, you have to make promises. these promises
            can make outrageous claims, and sometimes it's not even applicable to other businesses! the market results you gain is dependent
            on the type of business you are working on. there's is no one solution for all. it's just not an industry i want to be a part in. 
            and if i want to do marketing, i don't want to do it for another people, but for myself — i need to setup my own business.
            <br><br>
            fast-forward to what i'm doing right now. i decided to try and test out a business idea. the idea stems from my frustrations with 
            the lack of tailor-made note-taking apps for students when i was in university. my options were only notion, word, google docs, and others.
            but none of these had the solutions and tools i needed to succeed as a student. my idea then is to create a note-taking application
            designed for learning by making use of artificial intelligence and visual learning to make the process for efficient. i'm currently
            creating the website. my plan is right now is to test the idea in the market, see if it gains some traction, then go on from there.
            if the first steps are successful, maybe i'll look into pitching to investors or looking for a co-founder to do all the 
            technical stuff. we'll see, but i'm betting a lot on this idea right now. i don't know if it will work out. my visa ends on 30 may,
            and i less than six months to figure things out. it really puts so much pressure on me and lots of anxiety. it's an understatement to 
            say that it's affecting my personal life now too, but i'll talk more about it.
            <br><br>
            the business' name is notedaisy. it's sort of sounds the same as "note easy." but i wanted to add a touch of uniqueness to it, and 
            note easy just sounded... cheap. the daisy part means something to me to some extend. but i don't know if it will be for long.
            <br><br>
            to explain more on the "daisy" part, it has much to do on my emotional life. i went home last july after almost 18 months here in 
            sydney. sad to say, my emotional state before that has been very low. while i was home, i reconnected to some friends and just talked
            about life. with my one friend, i talked about the importance of having 'someone' or a 'partner' in life with you. i never understood
            the value of having someone by your side, nor have i ever sought it. actually, i did seek it but it was more of a friendly
            relationship and it didn't end up that way i expected it too.
            <br><br>
            anyway, i'll talk about that first. i liked a family-friend for at least 8 to 9 years. i met her when i was maybe 13 years 
            old. we met at least 3-5 times a year constantly but we never really became close. but i became really fond of her from how 
            she acts, her personality, and just how she treats me basically. things started getting traction during my junior year when 
            she enrolled in the same university degree as i did as a freshman. we reconnected and constantly chatted. however, because of the 
            pandemic things never really came to fruition, it was mentally draining, and eventually, what i thought was something 
            beautiful died out. she ghosted me for reaons i still don't know. i think she had troubles herself. i think she dropped out of 
            the university and doing something else right now.
            <br><br>
            anyway, for two to three years, that really hurt me to the point that it's becoming unhealthy. i talked about this with a friend, 
            and i realized that i've essentially been hurting myself from it and never really doing myself a favor by seeking someone else.
            eventually, i flew back to sydney and just one day, decided to put my foot down and help myself become more happy and start talking to someone.
            <br><br>
            around the same time when i was home, i met one of my high school friend's cousin. i knew about her 9 years ago when he tried to 
            introduce me to her but it was my first time seeing her.

            <br><br>
            <i>in summary, 2024 was a more interesting year—a year where i listened to my heart for once in my life. maybe i could've found what i was missing 
                if i did.
