            Part of Ateneo’s Freshman Application Requirements was to write a personal essay which I think centered
            around the question: explain a significant life event which shaped who you are.
          </i></p>

        <p><i>
            I still have this essay in my Google Driver folder. I vaguely remember telling myself that I really had to
            nail this essay because in my mind: It was Ateneo or nothing. My high school was terrible in terms of
            academics and spiritual exercise. I really wanted to taste what Ateneo was like: actual high standards of
            education and spiritual/philosophical dialogue centered around reason and intellectual reasoning.
          </i></p>

        <p><i>
            Me when writing this essay would’ve been surprised to not only pass the application, but also be able to
            enroll in Ateneo. August 2018 was one of the most special times of my life because for the first time: I was
            living one of my dreams.
          </i></p>

        <p><i>
            Four years later (even if half of it was ruined by COVID,) Ateneo remains one of the best things to have
            ever happened in my life. It not only made me a smarter person - but a wiser person in terms of how I view
            life, love, politics, and living in general. One of the most valuable possessions I have is my Ateneo
            Graduation Tassel which constantly reminds me that I am a proud Atenean living by the Ignatian values and
            principles

          Life is unfair. There are people who are born with a silver spoon in their mouth. On the other hand, there are
          those who are less privileged and suffer more. Just the thought of this is really despairing. I believe that I
          live somewhere in the middle. Nevertheless, I’ve had my fair share of sufferings and hardships.
        </p>

        <p>
          I’ve always yearned to have a complete family. I’ve wonder what it would’ve felt like if I had siblings who
          would be there for me as I walk through the crucial years of my life. During teenagehood, a person tends to
          become more emotional about everything. This makes it a very crucial period for that person and the presence
          of other people would help in this stage. As someone who spends most of his time being alone, this has been a
          really great challenge for me. For the past years, I’ve been very lonely and started to question about life.
          It was really challenging given my status in life, the events that transpired, and my social status. But in
          the end, it eventually defined me as a person.
        </p>

        <p>
          I was born a bastard and the only child coming from my mother and father. My mother is the one who takes care
          of me, while my father only supports me financially. Due to my mother and I being the illegitimate family, my
          father was not there for me as I grow up and for that reason, I didn’t have a father figure. This thought
          didn’t bother me during my childhood. But as I enter teenagehood, I realized how unfortunate life can be.
          Through my friends, I saw what it would’ve looked like having a complete family to live along with you
          everyday. Admittedly, I was very envious of them. I wanted someone to keep me always happy and to play with.
          Being an only child, spending most of his time alone, deprives me of this privilege and just by the thought
          that I will never experience this in my lifetime as a child and a teenager, disheartened me and it was
          somewhat hard to accept.
        </p>

        <p>
          Living alone is very saddening. Surely, my mother is always there loving me everyday and trying her best to
          make me happy, but I feel like a big part of me is missing. It’s very rare for me to experience happy moments.
          For the past summers, I didn’t do anything that could’ve made those summers worthwhile. It was also the same
          case for my last 2 birthdays. During those times, I spent the most my time either in my house or in school. In
          my 16th birthday, my mother wasn’t around and I spent it all alone along with the stress of school (It was the
          day before our final exams). My mother got a free trip to Japan by her friends. The thought of my mother going
          to another country (Which is what I want to do) during my birthday is very depressing. These events proved to
          me that life really is unfair and It was through these events that I didn’t yearn that much for happiness
          anymore.
        </p>

        <p>
          These events in my life defined who I am today. Through my experiences and misfortune in my life, it inspired
          me to become someone better. My goal in life is for me to have a complete family. With this in mind, it
          inspired me to become a better person. In spite of all the negative experiences that I had in life, I still
          uphold my values as much as I could. I’ve never directed my anger towards other people. Through my mother’s
          love, I’ve maintained a good moral character. I always look at other people positively and love each of them
          equally. Furthermore, my simple goal is what inspired me to work hard. I’m able to motivate myself to do well
          in my academics. I want to prove to myself that I will be able to achieve that goal in my life. Overall,
          that’s how I would define myself coming from my experiences in my past years.

            Obviously, I changed a lot over the last nine years since writing this. I'm not sure if I still share the
            same dream. But one thing is for certain is that I still go by the same principles.
          </i></p>

        <p><i>
            Sometimes, I still ask myself how I managed to get in Ateneo. Moreover - if I even deserve to do so. I can’t
            imagine who I would’ve become if I didn’t study in Ateneo.
          </i></p>

        <p><i>
            I’m grateful with my SHS self that I didn’t throw away Ateneo for something/someone else - and that I was
            capable of dreaming and fighting for that dream at 17-years-old.
          </i></p>

        <p><i>
            While I am not a traditional/practicing Catholic, I still dedicate my entire being to the values
            Catholicism/Ignatian stand by.
