            Creating is fun and endearing. Literally as I am writing this first post, I am
            figuring out how the hell am I supposed to increase the line spacing between 
            paragraphs. If this bunch of text seem to not be "off," then you can rest knowing
            that I have successfully figured out a solution. :D 
            <br>
            <br>
            So, welcome! I have a lot in my mind lately and I heard journaling is a great way
            to make sense out of your thoughts (presumably). 
            <br>
            <br>
            Now, I had many options on the 
            best way to journal. I could have just bought a notebook? But nah, that's too old
            school and traditional. What about popping up Google Docs and collate them all in a 
            nice and nifty cloud storage? How about, no. 
            <br>
            <br>
            One time, I was going home from Alabang to Quezon City (about a 32 kilometer
            ride). I had two options; take a comfortable bus + train ride home, or take a 
            jeepney! Philippine jeepneys are these (mostly) old, worn-out, open-air, and
            inefficient vehicles which you WILL NOT want to commute in everyday (atleast for
            the average non-filipinos) — especially for a 30+ km trip. Guess which transport option I took? That's right,
            the jeepney of course!
            <br>
            <br>
            Looking back, I realized one thing about me — I always choose the difficult road.
            From making commuting to career choices, most of the time, I intentionally make my
            life difficult.
            <br>
            <br>
            I currently hold a degree in the Life Sciences (It's sort of like business and biology
            mixed into one. I don't know, my University makes these weird college progras
            sometimes). But, this was never really my degree in the first place. When I first
            entered college, my degree was in Management Information Systems (A mix of business and
            computer science — see my point?). By some spontaneous, outrageous, and crazy decision,
            I decided to switch degrees on my second year knowing full well that I will be better of
            career-wise in my first degree. It's not that I didn't like Life Sciences, it's just 
            that my economic circumstances will disallow me to pursue the type of career I want with
            that degree.
            <br>
            <br>
            Now, objectively-speaking: Life Sciences is much more difficult than Computer
            Science! Do not refute me on that. It is a well-known and established fact! Given this 
            hard fact, my brilliant self decided that my life, at this stage, is not hard enough for 
            me to be comfortable with it. Yes, I thought that learning about cell signaling
            cascades of different type of lyphocytes and protein structures of immunoreceptors is not
            enough!
            <br>
            <br>
            While studying, I was also proactive in extracurricular activities throughout my 
            entire four years in college. Not only that, the projects and roles I took on keep on
            adding becoming more difficult.
