            Creating is fun and endearing. Literally as I am writing this first post, I am
            figuring out how the hell am I supposed to increase the line spacing between 
            paragraphs. If this bunch of text seem to not be "off," then you can rest knowing
            that I have successfully figured out a solution. :D 
            <br>
            <br>
            So, welcome! I have a lot in my mind lately and I heard journaling is a great way
            to make sense out of your thoughts (presumably). 
            <br>
            <br>
            I had many options on the 
            best way to journal. I could have just bought a notebook? But nah, that's too old
            school and traditional. What about popping up Google Docs and collate them all in a 
            nice and nifty cloud storage? 
            <br>
            <br>
            One day, I was going home from Alabang to Quezon City (about a 32 kilometer
            ride). I had two options; take a comfortable bus + train ride home, or take a 
            rust old jeepney. Guess which transport option I took? That's right,
            the jeepney of course!
            <br>
            <br>
            Looking back, I realized one thing about me â€” I always choose the difficult road.
            From making commuting to career choices, most of the time, I intentionally make my
            life difficult.
            <br>
            <br>
            I currently hold a degree in the Life Sciences. But, this was never really my degree in the first place. When I first
            entered college, my degree was in Management Information Systems. By some spontaneous, outrageous, and crazy decision,
            I decided to switch degrees on my second year knowing full well that I will be better of
            career-wise in my first degree. It's not that I didn't like Life Sciences, it's just 
            that my economic circumstances will disallow me to pursue the type of career I want with
            that degree. Career 
            opportunities under Computer Science drawves much of what Life Sciences has to offer. To
            have a relatively stable career in medicine or research, it is almost a fundamental
            requirement to either go to medical school or pursue graduate studies. Yet, I still chose take
            Life Sciences because (a) I am more passionate about the sciences, (b) I want to help other
            people, and (c) I want to make my life harder (?)
            <br>
            <br>
            This brings me back to the first question, where should I do my journaling? Well the 
            answer is obvious, in my own, custom-made website! I brushed up my previous knowledge on
            CSS and HTML and got going to launching this blog which I will hopefully maintain in 
            the future.
            <br>
            <br>
            Why make life difficult? Why go to a harder college degree? Why move to Australia with
            no assurances of what will happen to you in the future? and why not just grab a notebook?
            <br>
            <br>
            I honestly don't know the answer to these questions. It could be my ego to always do things
            differently or it could be my
