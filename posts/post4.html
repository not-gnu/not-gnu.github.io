        <h2>be the fool.</h2>
        <h3>gnu | may 8, 2025</h3>
        <p>
            Autumn’s about to end, but it’s just becoming cold enough here in Sydney that the trees start to become yellow-orange. I first got in Sydney 16 February 2023—just at the tail-end of summer. I didn’t really feel the contrast between the climates of the Philippines and Sydney at that time because it was almost just as hot (but dry.) My first Autumn season last 2023 was very surreal. The air became drier, the trees start to shed, and the temperature continues to drop each week. I started to romanticize life again.
            <br><br>
            Anyhow, my previous prompts here were made while I was under immense emotional distress. It got me thinking: under what instances to do I find myself making and appreciating “art?” Why must I only find meaning and beauty when it’s convenient? Why can’t I do it all the time.
            <br><br>
            I try to remember the times when I do sketches, when I find myself playing a guitar, or when I find myself writing in this blog. Back in Elementary - I would usually ace my music and art classes. I rarely failed on my recorder recitals, I put a lot of thought of the paintings I made, the oil pastel artworks, poems I need to write, and many others. This curiosity and passion eventually became a habit. I loved sketching anime drawings to the point that I was literally selling some of them during 5th grade. My passion for learning music extended to musical theater and learning how to play the violin. I loved using a camera. I most especially love taking photos, filming - creating scripts, framing, editing, and all those little stuff.
            <br><br>
            Eventually, these just stopped. I stopped sketching. I abruptly ended my violin lessons. I stopped writing. The spark just died. The reason? I was growing up.
            <br><br>
            Growing-up and entering High School was a turning-point in my life. Suddenly, I had more responsibilities and I was exposed more to the harshness of the world. I compared my life to other people and starting hating myself for it. The demand for academics overwhelmed me to the point that it was all I can think about. I realized how unprivileged I was compared to my friends, and I beat myself up for it. My mom was also not very encouraging to make me pursue those habits - often just letting me rot. At that point, art became a privilege. I had to survive first. My talent and potential was unrealized.

            <i>embedded video remove due to some issues. watch <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WRS9Gek4V5Q">Ethan Hawke's speech on "Give yourself permission to be creative"</a></i>>
            <br><br>
            When I first heard about Ethan Hawke, I didn’t know he was an actor at first. Only later did I know more about his work after his role as Arthur Harrow in Marvel Studios’ Moon Knight and as Jesse Wallace in Richard Linklater’s Before Trilogy (I really need to explore his filmography.) Before those, I knew about him on his TED speech entitled “Give Yourself Permission to be Creative.” I didn’t know I first encountered his speech, nor did I understand it that deeply. But somehow, just awhile ago, I just recalled that one line: “give yourself permission to be creative.” I rewatched his speech, then it all made sense.
            <br><br>
            Creativity is an expression of life’s extremes. It is the materialization of what was felt for others to feel. It is a way to communicate feelings which words cannot do justice to.
            <br><br>
            For creativity to make sense, one must be able to feel. To pursue what you love and what you’re interested in. And that becomes your passion.
            <br><br>
            <i>“Art is not a luxury, it’s a sustenance.”</i>
            <br><br>
            What does it make of my life then? Why do I only have my artistic side when it is convenient? Why doesn’t it come up when I needed it to.
            <br><br>
            I think that’s just the point. We’re intrinsically not concerned with art until it’s convenient to us. When we long for something, we tend to read poems, watch films, or listen to music with the similar theme.
            <br><br>
            “Iris” by The Goo Goo Dolls has long been touted as soulful expression of life. Before it was just another pop ballad bearing on significance to me. After I’ve loved and knew what “falling in-love” truly felt like, I resonated with the song in a different way. I never liked Taylor Swift before the 2020s. When she released her albums Folklore, Evermore, Midnights, and The Tortured Poets Department, she became one of my most favorite artist in the world, because folklore came at a time when I explored love and heartbreak. My soul resonated with her lyrical metaphors of loving and being loved. I had a toxic heartbreak at 2019 and I started listening to The 1975. This song reminds me of her, now it's at the top of my Wrapped. Things just started to make sense, while at the same time, those things wanted to be expressed. That is art. That is creativity - making make sense of the world as per the subheading of my blog.
            <br><br>
            That is also how art evolved from a child-like wonder to a mature perspective. Art manifested in me as a naive kid who had no worry about the future, and expressed myself with very little meaning. As a matured, it didn’t go away - it evolved. Art manifested in how my emotions has changed. I resonated more with rebel, pop, or party songs which eventually turned to indie folk, soft, alternative, and introspective music. My sketches evolved from innocent anime and senseless airplane drawings to artistic sketches of life, love, and passion.
            <br><br>
            <i>“Human creativity is nature manifest in us.”</i>
            <br><br>
            I’ve always yearned to create my own music and film my own short films. However, there is no denying it — art is still a privilege. If I had the money, stable life, and different circumstances, I would’ve sure taken a more artistic career. 
            <br><br>
            But do not hurt yourself for not exploring those hobbies in the past. We choose our own ways of expression and choose our preferred mediums of appreciating them. For now, I have my iPad and a laptop. What more can I do with a camera, an instrument, and more importantly, time and peace.

            <b>The Challenge: Playing the Fool</b>
            <br><br>
            When Ethan Hawke said to give yourself permission to be creative; a better way to understand it is to give yourself permission to become a fool. If you truly are an artist, want to express your creativity, to be seen and appreciated; allow yourself to be vulnerable. <i>“Follow your heart. Follow your love. There's no path till you walk it, and you have to be willing to play the fool.”</i>
            <br><br>
            A month ago, I was too safe and secure. I didn’t allow myself to be vulnerable and have an avenue for self-expression. As such, I didn't love that way I want to love. I only watched secure films, I only listened to popular songs to drown out any emotions like The Weeknd, K-Pop, or any other comforting media. I was simply too busy and preoccupied in life, because art (and loving) is a privilege.
            <br><br>
            In my emotionally vulnerable state, I allowed myself to express my heart in different ways. To write in this blog, to listen and explore different music, and to try to see the world differently - to be secure with who I am. 
            <br><br>
            Play the fool. Embrace your emotional vulnerability and express it. Don’t hurt yourself too much if you can’t draw or to perfect your writing — art is in the expression, not the product. And most especially, do not be scared. You will never be truly happy and heal otherwise.
            <br><br>
            <i>Learn to express yourself to others. This is the way to healing; to love. “Listen to me, and I’ll listen to you.”</i>
