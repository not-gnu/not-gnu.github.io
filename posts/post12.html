        <h2>cyclone.</h2>
        <h3>gnu | july 2, 2025</h3>
        <p>
            Today, a “bomb cyclone” was forecasted to hit the Australian East Coast. Strong rain and wind was forecasted the entire day, and I was on my way to the city. Twelve-degrees Celsius was forecasted, but the strong winds made it feel like five-degrees. 
            <br><br>
            I was shaking while waiting for the bus ride home. The bus came, hopped-in the warmth of the bus away from the piercing cool winds. You can barely look outside the bus’ huge windows due to the mixture of rain and cold outside. The bus makes it’s way across the Sydney Harbour Bridge. What was once a picturesque view of the harbour in a bright sunny day, turned into an eery and foggy afternoon from the bridge. A slew of thoughts and emotions fill my brain. The feeling of anguish hit me: a slurry of despair and loneliness. I started crying.
            <br><br>
            My phone had stayed silent other than the frequent business-related messages I get from clients and my partners. Weeks, and even months had past since any friend had last messaged me. I’m used to the silence. I’ve learned to be comfortable with it growing up. But sometimes, even the silence can become defeaning. You’ll miss the times where someone will have that urge to be interested with what’s going on with your life. You’ll miss someone - to care.
            <br><br>
            A few days ago a friend had messaged me. He was asking for a document I made for an organization back in college for his clerkship. I told him that the files are long gone. I asked why did he need it for clerkship - no more response.
            <br><br>
            A few days ago, it was my blockmate’s birthday. I greeted her. She said thanks, that she’s just tired, and asked how I am. Told her that I’m just busy. Asked what’s up - no more response.
            <br><br>
            I tried reaching out to some friends back then but it I always get the same answer: no response.
            <br><br>
            I looked back on those moments while on that bus. An agonizing reality hit me like the harsh winter winds: no one cares about me.
            <br><br>
            I asked myself what’s wrong with me. Why does it seem like no one care about me? Could it be because I learnt how to be dependent on myself growing-up. Could it be also because I learnt how to internalized my vulnerabilities and not share it with other people. But why is it that no one cares about me as if I’ve done something terrible to them?
            <br><br>
            I know that they are just busy or maybe they are just shy, or maybe scared of me? 
            <br><br>
            But why is it that on my most vulnerable moments in my life where I really needed someone, no one was ever there on my side? I can internalize them on my own, but sometimes; I do want someone to just care. To just ask how I’m doing; to make me forget about whatever is bothering me.
            <br><br>
            What’s amplifying these emotions is the idea of love that is lost. The love that is wasted; the one that’s not given back; or given to someone else. 
            <br><br>
            I feel like any loving I give to someone, it will be given to someone else. As if I was just a step for them to realize them to realize something missing on themselves. Rarely, that love is given back to me - but to someone else instead.
            <br><br>
            Yet, I still try to love. I try to love in the little imperfect ways which I know growing-up. I’m shy and constantly anxious, but I still try to love. Even if it hurts, as long as I try to love.
            <br><br>
            But, I always I feel like pieces of my heart had been constantly stolen from me. I distrusted the people, friends, and even the idea of romance. During the times where I try to trust people; the times where I give more of my heart, the bigger piece that is stolen.
            <br><br>
            They leave. They always leave. They don’t care about me.
            <br><br>
            Something is wrong with me. I feel like the biggest puzzle which I can never seem to solve is myself. My friends say that I’m good, that nothing’s wrong with me; but why does this constantly happen to me?
            <br><br>
            My heart just yearns for warmth, but all it gets are wounds that pierce deep through its chambers. For all my life: growing-up as an only-child, growing-up as someone who had himself, growing-up as someone who had no one to lean onto; just wants someone to share my burdens with. I just want someone who just accepts me as a whole, whom I can trust will take care of my heart.
            <br><br>
            There’s this one scene from a TV Show which always replays in my mind:
            <br><br>
            <span class="quote"><i>Michael: “Why can’t you accept that she’s an attentive partner and a good mom?”
                <br>Eleanor: “Because I wanted that mom! I wanted the mom who made me afternoon snacks. Why does Patricia gets the mom? If Donna Shellstrop has truly changed, then she’s always capable of change.. and *stutters* <b>I- I’m just not worth changing for.”</b></i></span>
            <br><br>
            The more I reach for it, the farther it goes: the more I distrust, the more I become distant, and the more I learn to only trust myself. Maybe Eleanor is right: we are just not loveable, nor likeable. Some people like us are just not worth changing for.
            <br><br>
            I get home and the rain continues to pour hard. The sounds of rain drops and the harsh gust of winds bring a sense of comfort. All the while, the cyclone also continues to builds in my head. Much like the comfort I find from this weather, I’ve also learnt to find comfort in the cyclone of my thoughts:
            <br><br>
            <span class="quote"><i>“You will always not be enough. No one cares about you.”</i></span>
            <br><br>
            Somehow, this self-advise is comforting.
            <br><br>
            It feels like I’m the only one I have left, as always; probably until the inevitable end.
