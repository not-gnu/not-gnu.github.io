        <p>
            Hey,
            <br><br>
            If you ever come across this, I’m really touched. You still think and care about me despite all of the things you said to me. I’m more secure now since we last talked. Don’t worry, I won’t put any emotional-stress on you. I just want you to know how much you were loved by me, how much I tried to know you, and considered <i>who</i> you are so much that I’m still thinking of you with so much empathy as of this time of writing. I also feel like you deserve a toughtful, secure message.
            <br><br>
            I am writing this not knowing if you’ll ever see this. I’ve written to you so many times already, but I feel you deserve a thoughtful letter about you. You may have forgotten a lot of details about us lately based on your last message about me, so allow me to recall.
            <br><br>
            Funnily enough, I didn’t like you as much as I did recently when I first told you that I like you. At that time, if you were to ask me if we should be “official,” I would’ve said “no” immediately. But it doesn’t mean I wasn’t fond of you.
            <br><br>
            When we first met, I thought you were pretty—but I’m sure a lot of people told you that already. Did I have a crush on you? Maybe. All I know is that I wanted to get to know you more. Deep-down I was longing to meet you and your cousins again before I flew back to Sydney because I was hoping to have another chance to hang out with you. But I knew you had the board exam coming-up and I didn’t want to bother.
            <br><br>
            While I was in Sydney, I didn’t have a crush on you, like that bad, but I don’t know. There was something or someone telling me that I should talk to this girl. As such, I was in constant contact with Armin hoping that I can find a way to talk to you. I kept on telling Armin that his cousins were so fun to be with, I talked about F1 despite not being that into it, and I remembered your boards and I told Armin to wish you good luck <i>(I’m sorry I forgot about this detail when we were together.)</i> Eventually, you guys asked for my Instagram details and I gave it. You three followed me.
            <br><br>
            You passed your boards and made a story about it and I congratulated you for it. Usually I would just like those posts, but I wanted to congratulate you personally because I wanted to talk to you. That was a really short conversation. I still remember you saying that you and your cousins are just x km away. Eventually, you met with your cousins again and you shared a story with your Ateneo shirt. Quite honestly, I would’ve raised my eyebrow and  brushed it off then, but I really wanted to talk to you more and so I commented on it. That’s where we just started talking and talking.
            <br><br>
            Slowly, I started to have an actual crush on you. Me liking someone is not about looks, but more on personality—how they treat me. We talked about a lot and we shared a lot of interests. We were curious about one another and asked things about ourselves. We shared Niki songs, our relationship traumas, our college experiences, our hate for BINI, and many others. You shared songs with me like Apple Cider which I really liked. We found that we both loved Justin Bieber’s older albums. You would share your Cebu experiences with me, and I would share you my own. I always looked forward every night just to talk to you. I had Kirby then and I would always show you how cute he is. I felt like I finally wasn’t alone in the world and there was someone who enjoyed my company.
            <br><br>
            Slowly, our interest in one another started to show. We shared sunset pictures, cute reels, and many other things. We started to be concerned with one another saying that we deserve to be loved and happy. You told me your dream of opening your own bookstore and really hit me then.
            <br><br>
            I had my issues before where I would hide my true feelings to people whom I can potentially have a relationship with. All of those, usually end up dying because I wasn’t clear or true to my feelings to tell them that I also like them back. I didn’t want that to happen to you. I told you I like you and you said you like me back. It was the first time someone had ever said that to me and you don’t know how closely I hold that moment in my heart even if it’s just through text chat.
            <br><br>
            But like what I said, I wasn’t sure of you then as much as I am recently. We were only talking for a few months and I barely knew who you were deep down. Believe me that much like you, I want to be sure deep-down and in my heart that I want to be with someone, and that requires an understanding of who that person is and whether I can trust that person to be there for one another when it gets tough.
            <br><br>
            We never went that deep, sadly—or at least, we never had that deep conversation. Conversations like your favorite movies had, or just being comfortable with one another that we can trust each other to really fall.
            <br><br>
            I remember when you went out with your cousins and you said you had this crying session with them. You sort of almost showed yourself with me, but you immediately backed down and said sorry. I guess you were scared too of showing your inner feelings as much as I was scared that I might uncover some sensitive things which you don’t want to talk about.
            <br><br>
            But it’s my fault, really. It must be tiring for you to hear this, but it’s true—I’ve never been loved before to know what deep love is. I can’t even have deep conversations with my mom. I learnt over the past years how to keep things to myself because that’s how I survived. My mom tried, but she wasn’t perfect. I’m sure you know of the typical Filipino saying of <i>“sumasagot ka pala ah.”</i> as a way for them to keep their ego and limit their children from speaking out. My mom was also like this, at least before. Even my grandmother when she was still alive and living with us. It was traumatizing and I carried it with me. I learned to just keep shut off my feelings and just be good. What’s more, I was an only-child. There was no one for me to lean to other than myself. I learnt to avoid those deep conversations and do things quietly. Unfortunately, that bleed into my relationships in the past, my friends, and to you.
            <br><br>
            I’ve been reading my past chats with my friends recently. I realized how cold my messages were and how I always stop myself from opening-up to people. I guess whenever I do, I just get disappointed, you know? Or maybe people just won’t understand what I’m going through because I don’t understand it myself. Or maybe I just always fear that no one will ever value me the way I wanted to be valued. It’s all of my fears and anxiety bottled-up to lead me to be the person who I am right now. I have this one friend whom I talk to a lot during COVID. One-time I just shut myself off. She noticed it without me saying and asked if I was okay. I wasn’t but I was never honest and just said “I am” and changed the topic to something academic related. This caused me a lot of friendships along the way. I don’t talk to anyone from Ateneo anymore. From High School, it’s just Armin. I’m surprised we’re still the way we are honestly.
            <br><br>
            I don’t blame you for not feeling that “something” with me because that is just how I became. I keep things to myself and I cannot express things when they matter. I don’t understand nor love myself enough to do so. I don’t expect you to do so too because what opportunities have we had for you to see and understand me? I told Armin that he’s the only person to ever see and understand me more than I understand myself, because we had two years to be together as classmates in a really toxic environment and he really saw me back then despite not talking much. If our circumstances were different, maybe you would have /seen/ me and found something deep below what I show on the surface. Deep-down I did yearn for it as much as you do, but I never just felt nor discovered it to know what it is.
            <br><br>
            Going back, us being scared about talking about these stuff unearthed our inner-traumas. And when they showed, we didn’t understand each other enough to healthily navigate through it. You already know how much I regretted what happened towards the end of November so I won’t go into that. I guess I’m just so good at burying emotions that with enough time, I will have forgotten about it. That’s why I started writing here. I was really hurt last January and I really buried those emotions and forgot about what we were arguing about. When we met and dated, we went so fast with it to the point that again, we were too scared to talk about it and fear that we might regress. Well, to be fair, it was our first official “dates,” and it was my first with someone who was actually interested in me, so a lot of things were really going on, but yes. It’s really my fault haha. We were just too scared again and focused on the dopamine of it that we failed to truly connect with one another again.
            <br><br>
            Anyways, enough of that. This one’s about you.
            <br><br>
            I’m sorry if I put so much emotional stress onto you. I guess back then, I just wanted to talk, but you were just pushing me away—you were so sure and it broke me. I just want you to know that what you felt was valid. It’s not your fault that you are who you came to be. Much like me, we have our toxic relationships with our parents and other people to blame for that. You wanted a deep connection: for your soul to be seen and to love someone that you are so sure of that you won’t even think twice about it anymore. I hope you still feel you deserve that. I accept that it’s not me.
            <br><br>
            Deep-down, I don’t hate you for being who you are. Yes, I do try to make myself angry at times, but that’s just me trying to suppress the emotion. I don’t know what more I can write here after all of those things I wrote for you. But like I said, I really fell for you much deeper than I did months ago. I don’t know why, but I’ll try my very best to explain this feeling—just to show you that you are worth loving despite the walls you built.
            <br><br>
            The more I understand you, the more I just fall for you more. I guess it’s just in my instinct to make people happy—to show at least some kindness in a world that’s full of toxicity. I hope you also felt that I’ve always attempted to understand you in my own way.  I’ve always understood what your parents put you through. You weren’t treated well in your previous relationships. The SHS guy may have made you feel the most seen, but left you confused. Guys treated you like shit and please know that you do not deserve it.
            <br><br>
            That time when we were sitting by the window in 27K was when I really fell for you. I told you that the reason I went home was just to see you, and that I’ll love any version of you you put up. You kissed my hand. It was the first and only time I ever saw you vulnerable in person.
            <br><br>
            Part of me wants to believe that you didn’t mean most of the stuff you said. Yes, there are some truths to it, but I know you wanted to protect yourself from the strong emotions I just gave to you. I always think about who I am to you. So much that I asked you on our last night in Cebu: <i>“Am I the right person for you.”</i> You said yes. You have no idea how much I remembered you saying that.
            <br><br>
            I know it’s really hard to trust me, or anyone. And I don’t blame you for that. I didn’t make it any easier for you to do so. Please know that I do not see you as too much, too broken, or too complicated. I saw a heart that wanted to be loved but didn’t know how to give it.
            <br><br>
            I don’t blame you for pulling away. I always remember every story you’ve told me about your parents and previous relationships. There is no shame in protecting yourself the only way you knew how—by letting go before you could be let down. 
            <br><br>
            You don’t need to carry the shame of pushing me away. I forgive you. I’m not angry. I just want you to find peace—with me, with yourself, with the love you were never taught how to hold. The pain that I feel right now? It’s not what you did to me. It’s how you treated yourself such that the girl I loved is lost somewhere deep in your heart.
            <br><br>
            If you ever feel like you messed it all up—please remember that I saw the real you, even if only for a moment. And that version of you? She was worth everything.
            <br><br>
            <br><br>
            I’m sorry again for putting too much emotional pressure on you. Thank you for caring enough to be curious about what's in my mind and browsing this site. As of writing this I really want you to know still:
            <br><br>
            I still think about you a  lot.<br>
            I still dream about you.<br>
            I worry you’re not taking this well.<br>
            I hope that you’re happy right now.<br>
            I wish I can cook your baon everyday.<br>
            I wish I could cook for you everytime you go home.<br>
            I wish I can give you the warmth you need when you leave the cold lab.<br>
            I wish I was there to buy you things and help you financially.<br>
            I yearn for your touch again.<br>
            I want to feel your warmth again.<br>
            I still think about you when doing “it.”<br>
            I don’t want to be touched by anyone else other than you.
            <br><br>
            That’s what I feel at the time of writing. I’ll lose these feelings someday. ‘Till then, this will exist here if ever you care enough to come across it.
            <br><br>
            <br><br>
            This is not a plea to come back - but a message as someone who’s secure. For the record: It’s been 3 months since that last night we had. Like I said, I will promise you something ‘till then. This was what it was:
            <br><br>
            My visa is expiring next Friday. I’m heavily considering returning to the country for 4 to 6 months while waiting for the next visa. I can bring my work with me anywhere. I sent out feelers for remote work in outsourcing jobs in the PH and I got a lot of interest due to my Australian experience. Right now, I’m really considering doing that to help me earn more money. If I were to do so, I would hate it to be back in Manila. I would choose to stay in Cebu. Other than you, I actually really liked it there. Two weeks will tell when I will have made the final decision.
            <br><br>
            I won’t tell you where I end up. I don’t even know if you’ll see this message. I won’t look for you in Cebu if I choose to stay there. I’ll make my own friends and memories on my own terms without you.
        </p>
