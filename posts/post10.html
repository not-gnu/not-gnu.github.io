            Last night, I felt like I was going to die. I had a massive fever the entire day. Moreover, it was a cold night that was less then 10 degrees Celsius. The cold was suffering. My head was also burning in pain. I had some slight issues with regards to my visa. Once again, to go home was on the table. It hurts. I kept thinking about what will await me back home. Again, I begged for a sign to make the decision easier for me - but it never came. I put on my fleece socks, a scarf, gloves, a beanie, and another layer of blanket and tried to sleep it off.
            <br><br>
            I weighed the options on going home vs. staying here. Going home means leaving the stress and anxieties I face at a regular basis even if its temporary - to live happily without the worry of the future. But at the same time, I’m throwing away potential connections and opportunities I may face while I’m here. My mind was already settled long ago: to stay here. But there’s one factor which makes me reconsider making this penultimate decision.
            <br><br>
            I found myself slowly falling in love to a girl over the past 10 months. It was the first time I ever confessed it to someone. I never felt happier in my life. It’s as if I found a reason to live. Unfortunately, the scars start to show when things start to get rough.
            <br><br>
            It saddens me that I never quite felt the words of Scott Peck from her.
            <br>
            <mark><i>“Genuine love is volitional rather than emotional. The person who truly loves does so because of a decision to love. This person has made a commitment to be loving whether or not the loving feeling is present. ...Conversely, it is not only possible but necessary for a loving person to avoid acting on feelings of love.”</i></mark>
            <br>
            During our first argument last November, one thing stood out which triggered my anxiety: that there was another guy. Though I trusted her, really. But her actions and mannerisms speak otherwise. I just thought to myself that maybe it’s just her.
            <br><br>
            I have no doubts loving her. It was the most sincere and courageous thing I’ve ever done in my life. Love is <b>volitional</b> rather than emotional. It’s a <b>decision.</b> As imperfect as it was, I really tried. I flew through continents just to see her, bought her gifts, wrote her letters, and drew her. I did all I could with the resources we currently had. I let go my ghosts to only focus on her. I got to a point where I was ready to commit to loving and accept her for all of her imperfections.
            <br><br>
            Unfortunately for her, none of those ever got through to her. Only in our last argument I finally saw the reason behind my reservations on her: there was a guy - albeit not now, but from her past. I thought it was one of the guys he’s talking to right now <i>(I’m not the toxic person who dictate who my partner should be friends with.)</i> But it was her past - a guy whom she last felt that genuine connection with.
            <br><br>
            She said that she’s over the guy. But in reality, she silently does. Yes, it’s toxic. In a way, it’s also cheating. I felt this very early on but only realized it after we ended it. You’re not really over a guy if you still share a Spotify Playlist and constantly send songs to each other, silently. You’re not really over a guy if you try to look for that guy in another person. My friend said that the guy was disgusting and immature and that I shouldn’t compare myself to him. With all the guys we’ve encountered from the worst school you can imagine, I can’t help but know already what type of guy he was on about.
            <br><br>
            In the last letter she wrote me, parts of it felt really petty. It saddens me I wasn’t touched by it. She outlined reasons why she didn’t feel it to me. They’re really petty like forgetting to send a message - which I really remembered and tried to compensate for. I was hoping to cry, but all I got in my head was: <i>“Sorry for not being a fuckboy and a womanizer who knows how to play with the hearts of women.”</i> She never saw through my efforts and my sincerity - as imperfect as I was. She chose to cling to what she felt to another guy.
            <br><br>
            Maybe I loved the wrong girl after all. Or maybe the type of girl I loved was long lost before she met that guy. But I can’t help but wonder: if I was really true to my intentions, why did I still fail?
            <br><br>
            Part of me thinks that I’m too idealistic. Or maybe a long-distance relationship isn’t just for me. I used to think that my love language was physical touch. It was naive for me to think that it is the case back then, but after truly loving someone, it has changed.
            <br><br>
            Maybe we were just cursed with terrible timing. I sometimes ask myself how I would have treated her in an ideal scenario. She’s struggling right now. Struggling with life, money, and living independently. Back then, I would dream about cooking her work lunch, and cooking food for her every time she goes home. I dreamt of living our days out in our own apartment, owning a dog and a cat, and taking a stroll around parks when we can - the type of life I’ve come to fall in love with her in Australia. Maybe I was too idealistic to think this far that I didn’t focus on the now - what she needed.
            <br><br>
            Maybe also that we just have a different perspective on love. My idea of love had been heavily influenced by Scott Peck’s and Ateneo’s Theology classes. Moreover, I’ve come to realize Scott Peck’s idea of love in Australia through my mentors. Perhaps I was too ignorant to think that she shares the same ideas. I was wrong to assume that she thinks the same. For her, loving is to be seen and understood in her language. 
            <br><br>
            I thought that I was missing something, but I realized that Scott Peck’s words takes precedence here. To be seen and understood, someone must choose to love first unconditionally. She didn’t choose. She didn’t want to choose me unless she feels it first. She closed herself off because she keeps clinging on the love she felt with this other guy. She chose emotions first before volition. This lead to our first argument out of fear that there was another guy until our last.
            <br><br>
            It’s quote ironic that she thanked me because she didn’t feel that there was another girl due to her past relationships. When it’s to her I feel it to.
            <br><br>
            I guess the timing isn’t just right. She can’t let go of her ghosts as much as I let go of mine for her. Hopefully someday she realizes this - that the one thing that’s keeping her from getting what she truly wants is herself. That to be loved, to be considered, and to be remembered; she must first choose to love. As much as it can potentially hurt,  choosing to commit must be a prerequisite. I’m happy to have been courageous enough to do so and to really fall in love in the end.
            <br><br>
            Maybe it’s time to renounce all sorts of empathy I have for her. She didn’t choose to love me. She didn’t appreciate all the efforts I did and the sincerity of my love. Maybe she does, but she doesn’t want to show her heart to me, say the right words I want to hear from her, and make me feel seen and loved the way she wants. Maybe it’s time to accept that she’s just selfish. 
            <br><br>
            Maybe one day, she’ll have the courage to choose to love as much as I did for her. I’m tired of chasing. I’m tired of being the one acting selfless. Maybe one day, she’ll understand my philosophy on love, have the courage, and renounce her <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/SupportforWaywards/comments/16w7yby/selfish_love_vs_unselfish_love/">selfish infatuation.</a> That whatever type of love she saw with the other guy was toxic. That there is a healthy way of loving the he, nor her parents hasn’t shown her. She has to accept this as much as it may hurt her; to know this if she wants to feel truly loved and seen.
            <br><br>
            I’ve made a decision. As May and my visa ends, I’ll let it end with it this chapter of my life - the chapter where I took the courage of going to a new country, the courage of pursuing someone in the name of love, and the countless of risks I’ve made along the way.
            <br><br>
            I might not pursue loving again. Maybe in two or three years. I’m also imperfect. I failed her so many times. But that’s just because I’m not in any capacity to love someone with what I have in my plate. As good as it is, I can’t hurt someone because of my ambition.
