        <h1>a sycophantic, prophetic, socratic junkie wannabe</h1>
        <p>hellaur and welcome to my simple personal blog. i am a terrible writer, but i'll 
            do my best in expressing my thoughts and ideas for you to ponder about. i am 
            currently in sydney australia. i am a lost individual who doesn't know what to
            do in life. growing up, i have been an only-child. no one to look up to, no person 
            to aspire to become, no nothing. i lived both poorly and sort of rich. it's weird,
            i know. but my circumstance since i was a child has been very extraordinary which
            lead me to become a person without any sort of identity.
        </p>
